This code creates a web developer resume webpage using HTML for the structure, JavaScript to dynamically load content, and CSS for styling.

**HTML Structure**

The HTML file defines the layout of the resume webpage:

Head Section:

-It includes meta tags for character encoding and viewport settings to ensure the webpage is responsive.

-A link to an external JavaScript file (script.js) and an external CSS file (style.css).

-The title of the webpage is set to "Resume".

Body Section:

-The header contains a centered name heading and contact information (email and phone number).

-The main section includes:

    -An introduction section with a heading and a paragraph.
    -An education section with a heading and an unordered list for educational qualifications.
    -A technical skills section with a heading and an unordered list for skills.
    -A work experience section with a heading and an unordered list for job experiences.

-The footer contains links to social media profiles with icons and a copyright notice.

**JavaScript Functionality**

The JavaScript file fetches data from a JSON file (resume.json) and dynamically populates the HTML content:

-It retrieves the JSON data and parses it.

-The introduction, name, email, and phone number fields are populated with the corresponding data.

-The education section is filled with a list of degrees, universities, and years.

-The skills section is populated with a list of skills.

-The experience section is populated with job positions, companies, durations, and a list of responsibilities for each job.

**JSON Data**

The JSON file (resume.json) contains structured data for the resume:

-Basic information includes the name, contact details (email and phone), and an introduction.

-Education details are provided as an array of objects, each containing a degree, university, and year.

-Skills are listed as an array of strings.

-Work experience is detailed as an array of objects, each containing the position, company, duration, and a list of responsibilities.

By combining these components, the code creates a complete, dynamic resume webpage that can be easily updated by modifying the JSON data.
